Port pin direction inconsistency  
Hierarchical port(pin) WriteData[9] direction INOUT is not consistent with the directions of the cell pins/ports found at that level of the netlist hierarchy. Please review the design and consider changing the port(pin) direction. Both drivers and loads were expected for the net (WriteData[9]) connected to this Port, but both were not found.
